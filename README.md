# Todo Fullstack (React + Express + MongoDB)

This bundle contains two folders:
- client : React (Vite) frontend
- server : Express + Mongoose backend

Follow each README in the respective folder to run locally.

Notes:
- Frontend uses lucide-react for icons. Install dependencies in client before running.
- Backend expects MongoDB running. For quick testing you can run a local MongoDB or use MongoDB Atlas and set MONGO_URI.
